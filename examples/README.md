## Tips for Effective Agent Use

1. **Be Specific**: Include file paths, technologies, and requirements
2. **Provide Context**: Explain the current state and desired outcome
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Run dependent tasks one at a time
4. **Review Output**: Always check agent work before proceeding
5. **Iterate**: Ask agents to refine their output if needed

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Flag Implementation
```
1. architecture-specialist → Design feature flag system
2. scaffolding-specialist → Create feature flag structure
3. database-specialist → Add feature flag storage
4. test-specialist → Test feature toggling
5. documentation-specialist → Document usage
```

### Pattern 2: Microservice Migration
```
1. architecture-specialist → Design microservice architecture
2. refactoring-specialist → Extract service from monolith
3. docker-specialist → Containerize the service
4. devops-specialist → Set up deployment pipeline
5. observability-specialist → Add monitoring
```

### Pattern 3: Security Hardening
```
1. security-specialist → Full security audit
2. security-specialist → Fix critical vulnerabilities
3. dependency-specialist → Update vulnerable packages
4. docker-specialist → Harden containers
5. compliance-specialist → Verify compliance
```
