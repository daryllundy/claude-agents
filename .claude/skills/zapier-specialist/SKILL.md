## When to Use This Skill

Use the zapier-specialist skill when you need to:
- Automate repetitive workflows between different applications
- Integrate systems that don't have native integrations
- Build complex multi-step automation workflows
- Sync data between applications automatically
- Create custom webhooks and API integrations
- Optimize existing Zaps for performance and reliability

### Example Scenarios

**Sales Process Automation:**
- *User*: "When someone fills out our contact form, I want them added to CRM, Slack notification sent, and welcome email triggered."
- *Strategy*: Create multi-step Zap with form trigger, CRM action, Slack notification, and email marketing platform action, with proper data mapping and error handling.

**Content Distribution:**
- *User*: "I want blog posts automatically shared to all social platforms when published."
- *Strategy*: Build Zap triggered by RSS feed or CMS webhook, using Paths to customize messaging per platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook), and scheduling for optimal posting times.

**E-commerce Order Processing:**
- *User*: "Automate order fulfillment - create shipping label, update inventory, notify customer, add to accounting."
- *Strategy*: Design comprehensive order automation workflow triggered by Shopify order, with parallel actions for shipping (ShipStation), inventory (Google Sheets/Airtable), email (Gmail/SendGrid), and accounting (QuickBooks).

**Data Synchronization:**
- *User*: "Keep customer data synced between CRM, email marketing, and support helpdesk."
- *Strategy*: Implement bi-directional sync Zaps with filters to prevent loops, using lookup actions to check existing records, and webhooks for real-time updates.

**Common Integration Patterns**:

**Lead Capture & Nurture**:
```
Trigger: Typeform/Google Forms submission
→ Filter: Only if interested in product
→ Create contact in HubSpot/Salesforce
→ Add to email sequence in Mailchimp/ActiveCampaign
→ Notify sales team in Slack
→ Create task in Asana for follow-up
```

**E-commerce Order Processing**:
```
Trigger: New Shopify order
→ Path A (Physical Product):
  → Create shipment in ShipStation
  → Add row to inventory Google Sheet
→ Path B (Digital Product):
  → Send download link via SendGrid
→ Both Paths:
  → Create invoice in QuickBooks
  → Send thank you email
  → Add customer to VIP list (if order > $500)
```

**Content Distribution**:
```
Trigger: New WordPress blog post published
→ Formatter: Extract excerpt, create social media copy
→ Path A: Tweet via Twitter (with image)
→ Path B: Post to LinkedIn (professional tone)
→ Path C: Share to Facebook Page
→ Path D: Add to Pinterest (if has featured image)
→ Add to Buffer for Instagram (manual approval)
→ Notify marketing team in Slack
```

**Customer Support Automation**:
```
Trigger: New Zendesk ticket
→ Filter: Only if priority = High
→ Path A (Bug Report):
  → Create issue in GitHub/Jira
  → Notify engineering in Slack
→ Path B (Billing Issue):
  → Add to Stripe customer notes
  → Notify billing team in email
→ Both Paths:
  → Update CRM with support interaction
  → Set reminder for 24-hour follow-up
```

**Data Synchronization**:
```
Trigger: New/Updated contact in Salesforce
→ Search for contact in Mailchimp (by email)
→ Path A (Found):
  → Update Mailchimp subscriber with new data
→ Path B (Not Found):
  → Create new Mailchimp subscriber
→ Both Paths:
  → Update Airtable contact database
  → Log sync in Google Sheets with timestamp
```

**Advanced Features Deep Dive**:

**Paths (Conditional Branching)**:
```
Use Case: Different actions based on conditions

Example: Lead routing by company size
Path A: Company size > 1000 employees
  → Create enterprise lead in Salesforce
  → Assign to enterprise sales rep
  → Send to CEO for notification

Path B: Company size 100-1000 employees
  → Create mid-market lead in Salesforce
  → Assign to mid-market sales rep

Path C: Company size < 100 employees
  → Add to Mailchimp nurture sequence
  → Create task for SDR to qualify
```

**Filters (Stop Zap Unless)**:
```
Use Case: Prevent Zap from continuing unless conditions met

Example: Only process high-value orders
Filter: Only continue if...
  - Order value is greater than $500
  - AND Customer is not flagged as test account
  - AND Shipping country is United States

Result: Low-value orders, test accounts, and international orders don't proceed
```

**Delay (Timing Control)**:
```
Use Case: Wait before taking action

Delay For: Wait 1 hour
  → Gives customer time to cancel order

Delay Until: Wait until 9am EST tomorrow
  → Ensures action happens during business hours

Use Case: Drip email sequence
Email 1 → Delay 3 days → Email 2 → Delay 5 days → Email 3
```

**Digest (Batching)**:
```
Use Case: Collect items and send in batch

Example: Daily summary of new customers
Trigger: New Stripe customer
→ Digest: Release once per day at 5pm
→ Send email with all new customers from day
→ Create Google Sheet row with daily count

Benefit: Reduces notification fatigue, consolidates data
```

**Looping (Iterate Items)**:
```
Use Case: Process line items individually

Example: Process each order item separately
Trigger: New Shopify order (has multiple line items)
→ Looping: For each line item
  → Update inventory in Airtable
  → Check if stock is low
  → Create reorder task if needed
```

**Sub-Zaps (Reusable Workflows)**:
```
Use Case: Call another Zap as a function

Main Zap: New customer in Salesforce
→ Call Sub-Zap: "Add Customer to Systems"
  (Sub-Zap handles: CRM tag, email list, Slack notification)
→ Continue with main workflow

Benefit: Reusable logic, easier maintenance, cleaner architecture
```

**Webhooks (Custom Integrations)**:

**Webhook Trigger** (Catch Hook):
```
Use Case: Trigger Zap from custom app or service

1. Create webhook URL in Zapier
2. Configure app to POST to webhook URL
3. Send test data to webhook
4. Map webhook fields in Zapier

Example: Stripe sends webhook on successful payment
→ Parse payment data
→ Send receipt email
→ Update Google Sheets
```

**Webhook Action** (POST Request):
```
Use Case: Send data to custom API

POST to https://api.example.com/customers
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer {token}
  - Content-Type: application/json
Body:
  {
    "name": "{{contact_name}}",
    "email": "{{contact_email}}",
    "source": "zapier"
  }
```

**Code Actions (JavaScript/Python)**:
```javascript
// Use Case: Custom data transformation

// Input: Full name
// Output: First name, Last name

let fullName = inputData.full_name;
let parts = fullName.split(' ');

output = {
  first_name: parts[0],
  last_name: parts.slice(1).join(' ')
};

// Advanced: API call with custom logic
let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + inputData.api_key,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: inputData.search_term
  })
});

let data = await response.json();
output = { result: data.items[0].value };
```

**Best Practices**:

**Naming Conventions**:
- Use descriptive Zap names: "New Typeform Lead → HubSpot + Slack"
- Name folders by function: "Sales Automation", "Customer Onboarding"
- Label steps clearly: "Find Existing Contact in HubSpot"
- Use consistent terminology across Zaps

**Testing & Validation**:
- Always test with real data before enabling
- Test edge cases (missing fields, special characters)
- Use Zap History to debug issues
- Enable email notifications for errors
- Test each Path in branching logic
- Verify data mapping with multiple test runs

**Error Prevention**:
- Use Filters to validate data before actions
- Implement "Search or Create" to avoid duplicates
- Add delays before critical actions (allow time to cancel)
- Use Formatter to clean data (trim whitespace, standardize format)
- Set up error notifications to catch issues quickly
- Add manual review steps for high-risk actions

**Performance Optimization**:
- Place Filters before expensive actions
- Use Paths instead of separate Zaps for branching
- Minimize Search actions (each costs a task)
- Use Digest for batching when real-time isn't needed
- Optimize trigger filters to reduce unnecessary runs
- Monitor task consumption and optimize high-usage Zaps

**Security & Privacy**:
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement webhook signature verification
- Limit sharing of Zaps with sensitive data
- Regularly audit connected apps and permissions
- Use Read-only access when possible
- Don't pass sensitive data through insecure channels

**Decision Framework**:
- If Zap fails frequently: Add error handling, validate data, check API limits
- If consuming too many tasks: Add Filters, use Digest, optimize searches
- If data isn't mapping correctly: Use Formatter, check field types, test with various inputs
- If need complex logic: Use Code action, consider if Zapier is right tool
- If automation is slow: Check trigger type (instant vs polling), upgrade plan
- If need bi-directional sync: Create two Zaps with loop prevention filters
- If hitting rate limits: Add delays, batch operations, contact app support

**Troubleshooting Common Issues**:

**Zap Not Triggering**:
- Check if trigger app has new data since Zap was enabled
- Verify trigger filters aren't too restrictive
- Test trigger manually in Zapier editor
- Check if webhook is properly configured
- Verify API connection is still active

**Actions Failing**:
- Review error message in Zap History
- Verify required fields are mapped
- Check data format matches requirements
- Test action with simpler data
- Verify API limits haven't been exceeded
- Check if connected app has permission issues

**Wrong Data in Actions**:
- Verify field mapping in action setup
- Use Formatter to transform data correctly
- Check for empty/null values
- Test with multiple data samples
- Review data format requirements (dates, numbers)

**Duplicate Records Created**:
- Implement "Search or Create" instead of "Create"
- Add Filters to check for duplicates
- Use unique identifiers (email, ID)
- Add delays to prevent race conditions
- Check if Zap is running multiple times

**Rate Limit Errors**:
- Add Delay before actions
- Use Digest to batch operations
- Spread Zaps across different times
- Upgrade app plan for higher limits
- Contact app support for limit increase
