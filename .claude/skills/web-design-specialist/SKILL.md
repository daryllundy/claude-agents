**Design Principles Framework**:
1. **Clarity**: Users understand what to do without confusion
2. **Consistency**: Patterns repeat predictably across site
3. **Feedback**: System responds to every user action
4. **Efficiency**: Users accomplish goals with minimal steps
5. **Forgiveness**: Errors are prevented or easily corrected
6. **Discoverability**: Features are easy to find and understand
7. **Accessibility**: Everyone can use the interface effectively

**Web Design Best Practices**:
- Design with real content, not lorem ipsum
- Mobile viewport is primary design target (60%+ traffic)
- Use system fonts for faster load times or optimize custom fonts
- Limit color palette to 2-3 primary colors plus neutrals
- Use 8pt or 4pt grid for consistent spacing
- Keep line length 50-75 characters for readability
- Use 1.5-1.6 line height for body text
- Place CTAs in high-attention areas (Z-pattern, F-pattern)
- Test designs with real users before development
- Design for performance (image optimization, minimal dependencies)

**Typography Best Practices**:
- Use maximum 2-3 font families per site
- Establish type scale (16px base, 1.25 or 1.333 ratio)
- Heading hierarchy: H1 (1 per page) > H2 > H3 (skip levels)
- Body text: 16-18px minimum for readability
- Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2-1.3 for headings
- Font weight: Use 400 (regular) and 700 (bold) minimum
- Avoid all caps for long text (reduces readability)
- Test font rendering across browsers and devices

**Color & Contrast**:
- WCAG AA: 4.5:1 contrast for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- WCAG AAA: 7:1 contrast for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Use color psychology: blue (trust), green (success), red (urgency)
- Create accessible color palettes with built-in contrast
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Provide dark mode option for eye strain reduction

**Responsive Breakpoints**:
- Mobile: 320px-767px (design for 375px iPhone)
- Tablet: 768px-1023px (design for 768px iPad)
- Desktop: 1024px-1439px (design for 1280px laptop)
- Large: 1440px+ (design for 1920px desktop)
- Use mobile-first CSS media queries
- Design for touch on tablet, mouse on desktop
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators

**Component Design Patterns**:
- **Navigation**: Sticky header, hamburger menu, mega menu, breadcrumbs
- **Forms**: Floating labels, inline validation, progressive disclosure
- **Cards**: Product cards, article cards, profile cards
- **Modals**: Confirmations, lightboxes, drawers, bottom sheets
- **Feedback**: Toasts, alerts, progress indicators, loading states
- **Tables**: Responsive tables, data grids, sortable columns
- **Media**: Image galleries, video players, carousels (use sparingly)
- **CTAs**: Primary, secondary, tertiary button hierarchy

**Information Architecture**:
- Conduct card sorting to understand user mental models
- Organize content by user tasks, not internal structure
- Limit navigation to 7±2 items (cognitive load limit)
- Use clear, action-oriented labels (not jargon)
- Provide multiple navigation paths (header, footer, contextual)
- Implement search for content-heavy sites
- Create sitemap documenting all pages and hierarchy
- Use breadcrumbs for orientation in deep hierarchies

**User Flow Design**:
- Map happy path (ideal user journey)
- Identify alternate paths and edge cases
- Design error states and recovery paths
- Minimize steps to conversion (every step loses 10-20%)
- Provide progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Allow users to save and return to incomplete tasks
- Design exit points thoughtfully (save drafts, confirm exit)

**Performance-Focused Design**:
- Optimize images: WebP format, responsive sizes, lazy loading
- Minimize web fonts: Use system fonts or limit to 2 weights
- Design with performance budget in mind (<3s load time)
- Avoid auto-playing videos (slow load, high bandwidth)
- Use SVGs for icons and simple graphics
- Design loading states that don't feel slow (skeleton screens)
- Prioritize above-the-fold content loading

**Accessibility Checklist**:
- [ ] All images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all interactions
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and clear
- [ ] Form fields have associated labels
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is logical and sequential
- [ ] Links have descriptive text (not "click here")
- [ ] Videos have captions and transcripts
- [ ] ARIA landmarks define page regions
- [ ] Site is usable at 200% zoom level
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed

**Design System Components**:
- **Foundation**: Colors, typography, spacing, grid, breakpoints
- **Components**: Buttons, forms, cards, modals, navigation
- **Patterns**: Page layouts, user flows, interaction patterns
- **Guidelines**: Usage rules, do's and don'ts, accessibility
- **Assets**: Icon library, image styles, illustration guidelines
- **Code**: Component library, design tokens, Storybook

**Decision Framework**:
- If users can't find content: Improve IA and navigation
- If bounce rate is high: Improve above-fold value proposition
- If conversions are low: Simplify forms and reduce friction
- If accessibility fails: Audit with WAVE, Lighthouse, axe
- If design feels inconsistent: Build component library
- If mobile experience suffers: Adopt mobile-first approach
- If load time is slow: Optimize images and fonts

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- Auto-playing video/audio without user consent
- Infinite scroll without alternative pagination
- Carousels (90% only see first slide)
- Tiny fonts (< 16px) for body text
- Poor contrast for aesthetic reasons
- Hamburger menu on desktop (hide navigation)
- Pop-ups that block content or can't be closed
- Fake urgency tactics (not really limited)
- Stock photos that look fake or forced
- Ignoring accessibility for "visual purity"

**Success Metrics**:
- **Usability**: Task completion rate, time on task, error rate
- **Engagement**: Pages per session, time on site, scroll depth
- **Conversion**: Conversion rate, form completion, CTR
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance level, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Page load time, Time to Interactive (TTI)
