# Product Overview

Claude Code Agents is a collection of 24 specialized AI agents and 7 skills designed for Claude Code Pro users. The system enables developers to invoke domain-specific sub-agents for complex development tasks through natural language.

## Core Concept

Instead of a single general-purpose AI, this system provides specialized agents with deep expertise in specific domains (infrastructure, security, testing, etc.) that can be invoked as sub-agents within Claude Code Pro.

## Key Features

- **24 Specialized Agents**: Organized into 8 categories (Infrastructure, Development, Quality, Operations, Productivity, Business, Specialized, Orchestration)
- **7 Claude Code Skills**: Auto-discovered capabilities for e-commerce, social media, and workflow automation
- **No API Keys Required**: Works directly with Claude Code Pro subscription
- **Natural Language Invocation**: Simply ask Claude Code to "use the [agent-name]" for specific tasks
- **E-Commerce Orchestration**: Intelligent multi-specialist coordination for e-commerce transformation projects

## Target Users

Developers using Claude Code Pro who need specialized expertise for:
- Infrastructure setup (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
- Code quality (testing, security, performance)
- Development tasks (database design, frontend, mobile)
- Operations (migrations, dependencies, git)
- Business requirements (compliance, architecture, localization)

## Value Proposition

Provides deep domain expertise on-demand without requiring separate tools, API keys, or complex setup. Each agent operates autonomously with full file access and can be orchestrated for complex multi-step workflows.
