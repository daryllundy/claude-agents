# Claude Code Agents

A comprehensive collection of specialized AI agents and skills designed for **Claude Code Pro** users. These agents and skills work as intelligent sub-agents that can be invoked within Claude Code to handle specific development, marketing, and e-commerce tasks with deep domain expertise.

## What's New: E-Commerce Orchestration System

The newest and most powerful feature of this collection is the **intelligent orchestration system** for e-commerce transformation:

- **E-Commerce Orchestrator Skill**: Automatically analyzes e-commerce websites, scores them across 6 critical dimensions, and recommends the right specialists at the right time
- **E-Commerce Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates multi-week transformation projects, tracking progress and coordinating specialist consultations
- **6-Dimensional Scoring**: Design & UX, Platform Optimization, Marketing, Social Media, Automation, and Performance
- **Auto-Discovery**: Simply paste an e-commerce URL and watch the orchestrator identify issues and route to specialists
- **Proven Workflow Patterns**: Pre-configured sequences for new launches, store revivals, scaling, and market expansion

**Example**: "Analyze https://mystore.com" → Orchestrator identifies issues → Routes to web-design-specialist, shopify-specialist, instagram-specialist, and zapier-specialist in the optimal sequence → Tracks results and ROI.

## Skills

In addition to the 24 agents above, this repository includes **7 Claude Code Skills** - a newer format that allows Claude to automatically discover and use specialized capabilities based on context.

### What's the Difference?

- **Agents** (`.claude/agents/`): Explicitly invoked via Task tool with "Use the X-specialist..." syntax
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): Automatically discovered and loaded by Claude based on task context

Think of agents as specialists you call by name, and skills as expertise that activates automatically when needed.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code Pro subscription** - These agents require Claude Code Pro to function
- Access to your project in Claude Code

### Setup

1. **Clone or reference this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daryllundy/claude-agents.git
   ```

2. **(Optional) Auto-install recommended agents in another project**:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daryllundy/claude-agents/main/scripts/recommend_agents.sh | bash
   ```
   Run the command from the root of your project repository. The script scans the
   codebase, recommends relevant specialist agents, and downloads their prompt
   files into `.claude/agents/`.

3. **That's it!** No API keys or dependencies needed. The agents work directly within Claude Code Pro.

### Basic Usage

Simply ask Claude Code to invoke a specialist agent:

```
"Use the docker-specialist to create a production-ready Dockerfile for my Python Flask application"
```

Claude Code will automatically invoke the appropriate sub-agent to handle the task.

### Example Invocations

#### Single Agent Task
```
"Use the security-specialist to audit the authentication system in src/auth/"
```

#### Multi-Step Workflow
```
"I need to:
1. Use scaffolding-specialist to create a FastAPI project structure
2. Then use database-specialist to design a user schema
3. Then use test-specialist to add comprehensive tests"
```

#### Complex Task
```
"Use the performance-specialist to analyze and optimize the slow queries in the reports module"
```

## How It Works

These agents are specialized prompts designed for Claude Code Pro's Task tool. When you request an agent:

1. **Claude Code identifies** the appropriate specialist agent
2. **Invokes the agent** as a sub-agent with the Task tool
3. **Agent executes** with full access to Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, and Grep tools
4. **Results return** to your main conversation
5. **You review and proceed** with the next step

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Building a Secure API
```
Step 1: "Use architecture-specialist to design a RESTful API architecture for a todo app"
Step 2: "Use scaffolding-specialist to create the project structure"
Step 3: "Use security-specialist to implement JWT authentication"
Step 4: "Use test-specialist to add comprehensive API tests"
Step 5: "Use documentation-specialist to generate API documentation"
```

### Example 2: Optimizing Performance
```

```

### Example 3: Security Audit
```
"Use security-specialist to perform a comprehensive security audit of the payment processing code"
```

### Example 4: Containerization
```
"Use docker-specialist to create an optimized multi-stage Dockerfile for this Node.js application"
```

### Example 5: E-Commerce Transformation
```
# Orchestrated multi-specialist workflow
Step 1: "Analyze https://mystore.com"  # e-commerce-orchestrator skill auto-activates
        → Detects platform, scores 6 dimensions, presents priorities

Step 2: User chooses "Mobile UX" (scored 3/10)
        → "Use web-design-specialist to redesign for mobile-first approach"

Step 3: After mobile improvements, return to orchestrator
        → "What should we tackle next?"
        → User chooses "Instagram integration"

Step 4: "Use instagram-specialist to launch Instagram Shopping and Reels strategy"

Step 5: Continue workflow through remaining priorities
        → "Use zapier-specialist to automate order processing"

Alternative: "Use e-commerce-coordinator to execute the full transformation roadmap"
            → Coordinates all specialists through 8-week transformation plan
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and requirements
   - ❌ "Use docker-specialist to help with Docker"
   - ✅ "Use docker-specialist to create a production Dockerfile for my Python Flask app with health checks"

2. **Sequential Tasks**: For dependent tasks, execute one at a time
3. **Provide Context**: Include file paths, technologies, and constraints
4. **Review Output**: Always review agent results before proceeding
